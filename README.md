## My Approach

-   Data layering: API layer, service layer, use[Domain] hooks.
-   Domain-driven design (DDD): 2 domains, order, and products.
-   React optimizations: controlling the number of re-renders.
-   Quick first meaningful paint: static page generation.
-   API response data normalization.
-   Handling server errors, mainly with retries.
-   Responsive design and components approach.
-   Valuable end-to-end (e2e).

## What Was Missed (Due to Time Constraints)
- List Virtualisation
-   Cart subpage: However, you can buy products by clicking on the shopping cart.
-   Some todos were not addressed.
-   Unit tests for the business logic, i.e., adding a product to the cart.
-   Integration tests that test against mocked data.
-   SEO optimization.
-   Cleaner category listing, i.e., displaying 4 products + a "show all" toggle.
-   Review of linting and prettier rules.
-   Conventional commit messages.
